1
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:33,958
Tyler!

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,666
He's breathing, he's breathing.

3
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,791
Multiple gunshot wounds.

4
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,250
Airway's secured.

5
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,541
We've done everything we can.

6
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,333
It would be wise to consider a threshold.

7
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,333
Sis... it's not fair
to leave him like this.

8
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,166
I'm not giving up on him.

9
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,750
What was that?

10
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
Fuck off.

11
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,333
And we're going to hold for five.

12
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,666
Four, three, two...

13
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,250
Keep it slow.

14
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,875
Just go home, would ya?

15
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,125
Or what? You'll run over my foot?

16
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,833
That's about all I could do.

17
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,875
Thanks, Nik. For keeping me around.

18
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,875
Really excited about
this next chapter of my life.

19
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,750
Believe it or not,

20
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,833
it's pretty difficult
to let someone you care about die.

21
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,750
But you fought your way back.

22
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,291
You just have to find out why.

23
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,541
Zurab.

24
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,791
I just heard from the prison.

25
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,958
They're extending your brother's
prison sentence by ten years.

26
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,958
Governor.

27
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,833
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.

28
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,583
How are you, my friend?

29
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,291
I've been better.

30
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,250
One of our prize bulls is sick.

31
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,125
We have to kill him.
Bury him before he infects the others.

32
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,166
You asked me here to commiserate?

33
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,000
Walk with me, would you?

34
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,875
You said it was urgent.

35
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,875
I just heard that this morning
you signed off on

36
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,916
extending my brother's prison sentence
by ten years.

37
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,583
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.

38
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,125
The Americans are all over us.

39
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
When Davit and I were young,

40
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,333
I was to protect my brother at all costs.

41
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,083
My father would never let me forget it.

42
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,333
I contested his extradition to the States.

43
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,583
Kept him in a Georgian prison.

44
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,708
I even allowed his family
to be housed in prison with him.

45
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,250
Let's not forget who put you
in this office. And why.

46
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,333
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

47
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,041
One of our prize bulls is sick.

48
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,833
I told you.

49
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,916
My man! Looking good. Look at this.

50
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's with the shirt?
You lose a bet or something?

51
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,208
- Don't you like it?
- No.

52
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,125
I'll get you one.
What's your size, 44 regular?

53
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,125
I mean, you're little bit slimmer, no?

54
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,291
Shut up.

55
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,625
I missed you, too.

56
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,375
He wanted to pull the plug.

57
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,375
Nah, that's not true. She lies.

58
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,333
You would have been doing me a favor.

59
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,833
Next time. You have my word.

60
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,708
It's funny,
your sister said the same thing.

61
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,500
What the hell's this?

62
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,500
A gift.

63
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,250
You're welcome.

64
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
You bring my chickens?

65
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,875
We ate them.

66
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
- What about my dog?
- Oh, we ate her, too.

67
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,000
Jesus, Yaz.

68
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,958
I'm joking. She's in the house.

69
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,791
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Anything you want.

70
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, you could go on hikes,
learn to knit.

71
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,541
You know, try to reach mindfulness.

72
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,250
You're gonna like it here.

73
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,958
All right, brother.
I'll send you that shirt.

74
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,875
What's this?

75
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,208
We packed up your house.
This is all we found.

76
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,041
Your entire life fits in one little box.

77
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,708
Maybe it's time to change that.

78
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,541
When am I going to see you again?

79
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,791
When we have something to celebrate.

80
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,333
Enjoy retirement!

81
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,666
Yeah, piss off.

82
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,500
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

83
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,833
I wouldn't let 'em eat you, mate.

84
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,291
Fucking right.

85
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,458
Don't wake them.
It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.

86
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,083
Come.

87
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
No.

88
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,125
No?

89
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,125
Not tonight.

90
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,875
It's been weeks
since they've seen the sun.

91
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,125
They can't survive like this.
It's hard on them.

92
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,375
Hard?

93
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,875
He needs to grow up hard.

94
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,291
There are other places to hide.

95
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,125
Sure, in here your brother protects us.

96
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,458
But I don't want my son
to become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

97
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,041
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.

98
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
What are you going to do?

99
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,333
Drag me into your cell?

100
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
You forgetting you're my wife?

101
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
Not your property.

102
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,125
Maybe I raise them on my own, huh?

103
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,875
You would not be missed.

104
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,041
Mom, you okay?

105
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought you were sleeping.

106
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,125
- Are you sure you are okay?
- I'm fine.

107
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,666
I'm sorry.

108
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,291
It's okay, my love.

109
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,291
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

110
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,666
Maybe Dad is right.

111
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,166
I do need to grow up hard.

112
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,916
So I can become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

113
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,833
This is beautiful, honestly, but the tea?

114
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,000
Not so much.

115
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,375
You're out of milk, by the way.

116
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,958
You lost, mate?

117
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,833
Are you Rake?

118
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,750
I asked you first.

119
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,375
Yeah, but my answer depends on yours.

120
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,666
See, if you are Rake,
then you are the myth of Mumbai.

121
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,166
The legend that got
the journalist out of Congo,

122
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,125
that took down the two gangs
to save the mayor of Rio.

123
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,625
The honor would be all mine.

124
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,250
But I have to say, mate,
you're not living up to the hype.

125
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,666
What happened? You fall off a bridge?

126
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,416
How about you put my cup down,
hop in your car, and fuck off?

127
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,500
That's not very nice, is it?

128
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,750
Not when we've got a mutual friend
who's offered you a job.

129
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,125
I don't have any friends.

130
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,541
Yeah, well, this particular individual
seems to think

131
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,708
you're the only one that can do it.

132
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:16,625
Me? I'm not so convinced.
Can you even pull the trigger like that?

133
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,375
Now that's why
you haven't got any friends.

134
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,333
Why don't you go back and tell
whoever sent you that I'm not interested.

135
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,291
Yeah?

136
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,958
What if it was your ex-wife? Mia.

137
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,666
Is that dog wearing a Valentino shirt?

138
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,791
Yeah. A friend gave it to me.

139
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,333
So, Mia in trouble?

140
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,166
No. But her sister is.

141
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
What's she caught up in?

142
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,875
Well, she's currently in a Georgian prison
with her two kids.

143
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,750
Her husband's locked her in there.
Can you imagine that?

144
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,583
- His name's, uh, Davit...
- Davit Radiani. I remember him.

145
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,416
Probably the last time you saw him,

146
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,750
he and his brother Zurab were pushing
dime bags on the streets of Georgia.

147
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,458
But eight years later,
they've built quite an empire.

148
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,458
Call themselves the <i>Nagazi.</i>

149
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,125
It means shepherd, apparently.

150
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,000
The brothers were born into war.

151
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,375
<i>Raised in it. Hardened by it.</i>

152
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,833
<i>When they were kids,
they fled the civil war in Georgia,</i>

153
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,458
<i>with only their lives</i>

154
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>and escaped to Armenia.</i>

155
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
<i>Their uncle, Avtandil, took them in.</i>

156
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,125
<i>To this day, he runs operations for them.</i>

157
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,416
<i>But in Armenia,
they faced a new kind of war.</i>

158
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,333
<i>To survive the streets of Yerevan,
they turned to a life of crime.</i>

159
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,958
<i>Started running drugs in their teens,
graduated to murder for hire.</i>

160
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,000
<i>They believed they were soldiers,
chosen by God.</i>

161
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,666
<i>By the time they returned to Georgia,</i>

162
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,625
<i>they were folk heroes.</i>

163
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:02,666
<i>They offered their recruits
a very powerful thing... family.</i>

164
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,291
<i>And so the brothers gained
a cult-like loyalty.</i>

165
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,208
And with that,
they basically built themselves

166
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,833
a billion-dollar heroin
and weapons operation.

167
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,750
These brothers have got
all the politicians in their pockets.

168
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,791
They practically run the country.

169
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,791
If it wasn't for the Americans,
Davit would be free.

170
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,791
Location?

171
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,458
They're in the Tkachiri Prison.

172
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,916
Now listen to me, pal,
and listen to me really good.

173
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,666
In my expert opinion,
the problem isn't Davit or the guards,

174
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,541
it's the two warring gangs
that are imprisoned in there,

175
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,375
one of which would just wanna kill her,
but both of which'll wanna kill you.

176
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
Now, if I were you,
which I'm obviously not,

177
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,291
I'd want to get in there nice and quiet,
keep my head down,

178
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,208
because the moment Davit finds out
that his family's been taken,

179
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,833
you can rest assured that his brother
is gonna wanna throw everything at you,

180
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,166
and I'm talking
about the whole <i>Nagazi </i>army.

181
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,500
Sounds fun.

182
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,541
Job starts in six weeks. We take our cut,

183
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,250
and for, uh, political considerations,
you're on your own.

184
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,833
If all goes well,
you don't get caught or shot in the face,

185
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,291
I'll meet you on the other side
and give you a kiss.

186
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,333
Failing that? It's been a pleasure.

187
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,708
We can get a shipment
of weapons to Seoul by tomorrow night.

188
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,833
And my brother Yaz
will fly there to deliver it personally.

189
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,666
I have tickets to the game tomorrow.

190
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,125
Sorry, I have to call you back.

191
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,541
Tyler.

192
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,583
<i>Yeah, hey, Nik. So listen,</i>

193
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,708
the whole retirement thing
is not gonna work out.

194
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>Job came in.</i>

195
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,250
You were clinically dead nine months ago.

196
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,125
Yeah, well, I'm not now. Money should be
in your account pretty soon.

197
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,291
What are you talking about?
Why did they come to you?

198
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Haven't you heard, Nik?
I'm a bit of a legend now.

199
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,791
I think being in a coma
must have messed with your memory.

200
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>I </i>tell you what the job is
and when and how you do it.

201
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,416
Yeah, you also told me to find the reason
I fought my way back.

202
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,458
Let's find out.

203
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,934
You're gonna miss the game.

204
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,666
Fucking hell.

205
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,875
<i>One minute to target.</i>

206
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,500
You know,
my hands are super sweaty lately.

207
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,458
I don't like it.
Probably, have low blood sugar.

208
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,833
How do you know that?

209
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,833
- Saw it on TikTok.
- You need to get off medical TikTok.

210
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,083
- You're already edgy.
- I need to talk.

211
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,416
Every time I talk,
the phone hears me,

212
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,083
and I get more medical TikToks.

213
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,375
Then you should delete TikTok.

214
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, that's a terrible idea.

215
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,708
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

216
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,083
<i>All teams, eyes on.
Looking good.</i>

217
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,041
Freezing out there.

218
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,625
They don't want to sleep in the cold,
they shouldn't kill people for a living.

219
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,083
<i>Phoenix is at Alpha.
Teams two and three standing by.</i>

220
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,791
207 unlocked.
You got five minutes.

221
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,208
<i>Power is out everywhere.</i>

222
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,125
Going to check it out.

223
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,166
Hey.

224
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,125
Sandro, wake up.
We have to go. Get dressed.

225
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,708
Who is this man?

226
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,000
He's going to take us out of here.

227
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,458
Put your shoes on.

228
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,916
Where are we going?

229
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,666
I'll tell you later.

230
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,291
Dad?

231
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,500
Shh! Keep him quiet.

232
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,250
He's getting us out of here.
Your father's waiting outside.

233
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,791
Stay close.

234
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,791
Go.

235
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,041
- Package in hand. On the move.
<i>- Copy.</i>

236
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,666
Sorry, kid.

237
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,416
Move.

238
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,208
<i>Code Red.
Security, lock down the exits.</i>

239
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:44,250
<i>Security breach. All guards, Code Red.</i>

240
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,083
<i>Alert, perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

241
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,666
You'll have to get off your asses.
It's getting busy.

242
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,041
<i>Roger. We're ready.</i>

243
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,666
Fuck! Back, back! Back! In there! Move!

244
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,208
Don't push me.

245
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,291
You're scaring him.

246
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,833
Yeah, well, he's about to be terrified.

247
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:11,333
<i>Alert,
perimeter breached. Close down the exits.</i>

248
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,708
Stand back.

249
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,041
Stay back.

250
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,125
Fuck off.

251
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,416
Back off!

252
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,666
Go, go, go, go!

253
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,458
Yaz, I need a way out.

254
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,541
<i>Working on it.</i>

255
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,166
Which way, Yaz? I need some help.

256
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,375
<i>Forget Bravo. Too hot. Go left.
To the coal chutes, coal chutes.</i>

257
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,458
Roger. Moving.

258
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,458
- Which way? I'm guessing up?
<i>- Yep. ETA two minutes.</i>

259
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,250
Don't be afraid.
Go up, and I'll come up too.

260
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,458
Let's go.

261
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,166
Okay.

262
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,875
Where are you
taking my children? Motherfucker!

263
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,083
You bitch.

264
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,958
Tyler. We've gotta go now.

265
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,250
Take the kids, meet me at Charlie!

266
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:13,666
- What happened down there?
- Trouble.

267
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,500
Come on, let's go.

268
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,458
- Where's my father?
- Come on.

269
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,166
- We gotta go, hold her.
- Where's my father?

270
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,583
All teams move to Charlie. Now! Now!

271
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,875
<i>Alert,
riot in the square. Lock down the exits.</i>

272
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:41,083
<i>Alert, riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

273
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,083
<i>Alert, all units to the prison courtyard.
Close down all the exits.</i>

274
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,875
<i>Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.</i>

275
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,375
Any route to Charlie that isn't through
the common yard?

276
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,708
<i>Negative, negative.</i>

277
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,833
- Shit.
- Not through it.

278
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,250
There must be another way.

279
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,416
Stay close to me.
Keep swinging that thing.

280
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,166
<i>Close all gates. Guards, get to the walls.</i>

281
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,416
Go!

282
00:32:55,208 --> 00:33:01,000
Back off! Move! Back! Back! Back!

283
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,250
Rake! Help me!

284
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,000
Rake!

285
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,666
Rake!

286
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,541
Pull the pin!

287
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,750
Hey!

288
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,958
Help me!

289
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,916
No!

290
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,500
Help me!

291
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,458
Tyler!

292
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,208
Help me!

293
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:54,708
You all right?

294
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,125
We're at Charlie. Open up.

295
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,875
<i>Stand clear.
Breaching in three, two, one...</i>

296
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,791
What took you so long?

297
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,125
- Word's out. We got to move.
- The word's been out for a while.

298
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,125
We intercepted <i>Nagazi </i>radio calls.
They're coming at us heavily armed.

299
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,916
And they know their boss is dead.

300
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,208
- Does the brother know?
- We're about to find out.

301
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,791
Where are the kids?

302
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,750
In the car. Move. Go.

303
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,166
Hold on.

304
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,458
All right, everyone okay? Kids, you good?

305
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,666
Where's Father?
You told me he was coming.

306
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,333
He'll meet us later.

307
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,416
All right, put those on.
Get on the floor.

308
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,291
Shit.

309
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,333
Eyes up. Threat coming from the front.

310
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,708
<i>- Roger.</i>
- Those are Zurab's men.

311
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:06,125
<i>Team three, move up.
Tyler, we got your six.</i>

312
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,291
Got it. Nik, get rid of these guys.

313
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,375
<i>Already on it.</i>

314
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,166
<i>One threat down. One threat down.</i>

315
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,666
<i>Okay, we just pushed the last two
of them down. Drive, drive, drive.</i>

316
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,163
<i>Maintain formation.</i>

317
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,666
<i>- Copy.
- Copy.</i>

318
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,125
<i>Contact front,
turn right, turn right.</i>

319
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,250
Son of a bitch.

320
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,333
<i>Shit. We got multiple bikes,
and then an armed UTV, military-grade.</i>

321
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:01,250
Stack up.
Don't let them between us.

322
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,291
<i>Nagazi </i>are here.
Soldiers. These men are killers.

323
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,625
Yeah, so am I.

324
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,583
<i>We're hit!</i>

325
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,041
<i>Eagle's down.</i>

326
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,750
<i>Keep those bikes off me.</i>

327
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,125
- They must know about Davit.
- Yeah, feels that way.

328
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,833
What do they know?

329
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,625
Second bike down.

330
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,500
- Why are Uncle's men shooting at us?
- Are you okay?

331
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,208
<i>Nik, you got the last two bikes.</i>

332
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,250
<i>Keep them on your tail.
I'm coming in quick.</i>

333
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:16,666
<i>Hurry!</i>

334
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,625
<i>That fast enough?</i>

335
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,500
<i>Is that supposed to be funny?</i>

336
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:26,958
<i>UTV on our left.</i>

337
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,750
<i>Approaching exfil, straight ahead.</i>

338
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,916
Hang on tight!

339
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,625
Don't they know we're in this car?

340
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:43,166
Bravo team, we're two mikes out...

341
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,000
Shit!

342
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,125
Fuck!

343
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,916
- Look out, come on. Come on.
- Go, move.

344
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Reloading!

345
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:08,291
Okay, I've got you.

346
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,791
- The girl's hurt! We gotta move.
- Okay.

347
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,250
Push right through that door.
On foot. Sixty seconds out.

348
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:32,833
Take a left!

349
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,333
Right! Go right! Follow me.

350
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,291
Come on, guys. Keep it tight.

351
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:57,791
Team four! We're on foot.
Twenty seconds out.

352
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,458
- Yaz, slow them down.
- All right.

353
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,000
Friendly coming through.

354
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,791
Yaz, get us a med kit.

355
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,500
All right. Got it.

356
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,750
It hurts!

357
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,458
How bad is it?

358
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,166
Open fracture.
She needs a doctor.

359
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,291
<i>Heads up,
got gunships en route.</i>

360
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,500
Heading to the engine.

361
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,833
- Yaz, need you to take over.
- Okay, got it.

362
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,500
Got one helo, one's still there.

363
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:47,750
<i>Copy.</i>

364
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,208
<i>Reaper Team, in position.</i>

365
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,166
<i>Move, move.</i>

366
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,916
<i>Reaper 1 and 2,
you have to stop this train.</i>

367
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,250
<i>Copy, moving toward the engine.</i>

368
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,416
<i>Go, go!</i>

369
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,583
<i>Reaper 1 is down.</i>

370
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,125
<i>Breaching!</i>

371
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:48,625
Nik, you good?

372
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,041
Nik?

373
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,125
You okay?

374
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,375
Better than him.

375
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,250
Shit, get down!

376
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:21,833
Cover me.

377
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:50,916
We're reaching the end of the line.
Stop the train, Nik.

378
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,916
Brakes are out.

379
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,041
You're kidding me.

380
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,625
Yaz, secure the family. We got no brakes.

381
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,625
- We're almost there.
- Hold on.

382
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,000
My team's waiting for us
at the end of the line.

383
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,708
Gonna be a rough landing, hold on tight.

384
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:18,041
- What's going on?
- Figure it out later.

385
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,541
This was deeply resourced.

387
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:39,750
Lead operative was A-plus.

388
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,500
There's maybe four or five guys
who could've done this to us.

389
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,833
Was this the Chechens?

390
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,708
It's not their style.

391
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,625
They don't organize like this.

392
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,958
Someone wanted revenge.

393
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,500
With your brother, that's no short list.

394
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,250
No.

395
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,583
This wasn't revenge.

396
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,125
This was something else.

397
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,250
It's all right.

398
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,041
- Careful with her arm.
- Got it.

399
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,791
Where's Father?

400
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,416
There isn't time for this.
Your sister needs help.

401
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,625
I'm not leaving without him.

402
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,083
- Come on. Your sister needs help.
- I'm not going.

403
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:47,583
Your father isn't coming.

404
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,083
Is he dead?

405
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,166
Did you kill him?

406
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,541
Huh?

407
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,041
Did you kill him?

408
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,958
Please, Sandro.

409
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:17,166
Oh, Sandro.

410
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,500
- Listen to me! Hey, hey!
- Fuck you!

411
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,208
Listen to me!
He was gonna kill your mother. Okay?

412
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,500
It was him or her.

413
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,500
Sandro.

414
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,208
Davit!

415
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:39,125
- I tried to protect him.
- Is this protection?

416
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:43,750
You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood.

417
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,875
Full medical detail.

418
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:11,375
I need you to meet us
at Donau-City Strasse.

419
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,250
We touch down
in 45 minutes in Vienna.

420
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,291
Thank you.

421
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,250
We're almost there.

422
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,916
You all right? Need anything?

423
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,583
I'm hungry.

424
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,625
Let me see what we got.

425
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,000
Don't. She could aspirate.

426
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,875
I know how to take care of my child.

427
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,625
Calm down.
She's just trying to help.

428
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,083
Don't patronize me.

429
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,750
A doctor will be there when we land.
Try to rest.

430
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,750
Since when do you speak Georgian?

431
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,250
Since always.

432
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,458
She doesn't know?

433
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,916
He was married to my sister.

434
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,958
Thanks for the heads-up.

435
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,291
I was going to tell you when we landed.

436
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,375
Mmm.

437
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,083
You are a brave girl.

438
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,833
She's mad at you.

439
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:44,958
It's not unusual.

440
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,208
I should have stayed behind.

441
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:53,458
My children would be safer with me dead.

442
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:56,916
Hey, come on. You know that's not true.

443
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,625
We're almost there. You're almost free.

444
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,500
I'm gonna get you some place safe.
I promise.

445
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,291
Thank you, Tyler.

446
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:25,833
I'm listening.

447
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,916
Uncle... It's me, Sandro.

448
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Sandro? Where are you?

449
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,833
Was my father going to kill my mother?

450
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,125
Sandro...

451
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,291
Answer me!

452
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,958
Don't listen to anything your mother says,
you understand me?

453
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,833
She did this.

454
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,375
She had your father killed. Understand?

455
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,583
She has wanted to take you away
from your father for years.

456
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,000
<i>And now you are with the man
who killed him.</i>

457
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,791
<i>So where are you?</i>

458
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,333
You're a <i>Nagazi. </i>Be your father's son.

459
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,041
Where are you heading?

460
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,958
<i>Where are you heading?</i>

461
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,916
Remember when
I first met you in Brussels?

462
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,875
Mia was working for Parliament.

463
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,750
Yeah, you had your boy with you.

464
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,500
I was 19.

465
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,916
He was just a baby. So was I.

466
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,875
Listen, I know what your sister
must think of me.

467
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:49,416
There's nothing I can do to fix that.
I just want you to know that...

468
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,916
It's the most awful thing
a parent can endure,

469
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,416
watching a child die.

470
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:58,958
Thank you.

471
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,791
Okay, let's hustle.
I need them on a plane in six hours.

472
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,416
Multiple visas.

473
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,541
<i>Merci.</i>

474
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,250
That's nice.

475
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,083
You should get some rest.

476
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,583
Papers are in motion.

477
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,833
Why didn't you tell me?

478
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,833
I'm sorry...

479
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:45,666
I don't need your apology.
I need your trust.

480
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,375
I wouldn't have said no to this.

481
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:56,291
If it was important to you.

482
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:00,416
It is.

483
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:07,958
Thank you, doctor.

484
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,458
I can't imagine what it must have taken

485
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:31,791
to raise good kids
surrounded by those men.

486
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:34,708
But you survived.

487
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,916
You kept your kids from harm.

488
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:42,750
Found a way with nothing. Alone.

489
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:50,958
I know what it feels like.
I've been there.

490
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,791
Everyone deserves a second chance.

491
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:16,666
You think what you do is good?

492
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,416
You think you saved me?

493
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:24,125
That you're some hero?

494
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:29,666
Doesn't really matter what I think.
People pay me to do things they can't.

495
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,625
Like killing my father.

496
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,000
My mother hired you to kill him.
Didn't she?

497
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:39,208
No, what your mother did was risk
everything to protect you and your sister.

498
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,291
Save you from that prison
that your father put you in.

499
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,958
He didn't want to.
They'd have killed us on the outside.

500
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,166
- Who?
- The enemies of the <i>Nagazi.</i>

501
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,041
They'd have come for us and killed us.

502
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:51,208
He brought us there,
so he could watch over us.

503
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:55,291
- He brought you there to control you.
- No. He just didn't trust my mother.

504
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,375
Wake up, kid.

505
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:58,958
He knew she would take you and your sister

506
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,958
and give you a life outside of all that,
not stay trapped with him.

507
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:04,208
A good son
is supposed to stay with his father.

508
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:08,000
- A good father wouldn't make him.
- At least my father didn't leave us.

509
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,309
It's the most
important thing I'll ever ask you to do.

510
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:36,125
To rectify this desecration.

511
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,791
This filth came to our home
and murdered our family.

512
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,458
Our brothers.

513
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:45,958
By God's law, he must die by our hand.

514
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,875
You are my brothers. My life is yours.

515
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:54,375
I'll follow you to the end.

516
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,625
My life is yours.

517
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,333
And mine.

518
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,833
You're throwing their lives away.

519
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,958
This path doesn't end well.

520
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:31,041
"You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood."

521
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:34,375
I haven't forgotten my father's lesson.

522
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,291
Have you?

523
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,375
You and my son
met once before.

524
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:14,041
Played on the beach together.
I don't know if you remember.

525
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:18,250
He'd nearly be as old as you are now.

526
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,416
Last time I saw him,

527
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,916
he was sitting in a hospital bed
and drawing.

528
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,708
He had papers and crayons
spread out everywhere.

529
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,083
He used to love to draw.

530
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,583
I came to say goodbye
'cause I was shipping out to Afghanistan,

531
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:41,083
and I knew I might not see him again,
he might not be alive when I got back.

532
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:47,208
So I came to the hospital,
and there he was on the bed, drawing.

533
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,250
And you're right, I...

534
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,416
And I left.

535
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,708
Last thing my kid remembers
is me walking out on him.

536
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,416
But your mom, she stayed.

537
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,833
She stayed with your father for years
to keep you safe.

538
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,625
Even after all the things he did to her,
what you did and didn't see.

539
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,875
She stayed to keep you
and your sister safe.

540
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,125
I'm not gonna lie to you, mate,
shit's gonna get harder,

541
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,489
but you'll have to take care of her.
She's gonna need you.

542
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,375
So you can be there for her
like she was for you.

543
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,041
Or let your father's lies consume you.

544
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:46,958
It's on you, mate.

545
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,458
He wasn't always like this.

546
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:01,625
I'm sorry.

547
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,125
- Nah, it's okay.
- No.

548
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,875
He's coming.

549
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,583
Oh, kid, what did you do?

550
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,791
Attack team from north side. Move!

551
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,291
Pack it up. Let's go.

552
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,041
- We gotta move.
- What's going on?

553
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,166
They found us.

554
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,791
Take the elevator down.
Walk calmly out the front door.

555
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:05,125
I'll get to the garage,
use the armored cars to punch through.

556
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:06,208
Let's go.

557
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,750
Up or down?

558
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,833
They'll come down. More options.

559
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,125
The children?

560
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:31,083
MEET ME IN THE BACK ALLEY.

561
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,375
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry, Mama...

562
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,250
Sandro... What did you do? How could you?!

563
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,708
He doesn't care about you!

564
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,333
He's gonna kill us!

565
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,625
The <i>Nagazi </i>are my family.

566
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:06,833
I am your family.
Nina is your family!

567
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:16,375
- Get down!
- Get down!

568
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,875
Come on.

569
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:49,041
Chopper on the roof.
They're pinching us in.

570
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,708
Let's go! Come on. Move. Move.

571
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:33,041
- We'll punch a hole. Break you through.
- Thank you.

572
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,541
Go. Get in the car.

573
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,416
Sandro!

574
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,000
- Sandro! Kid, wait!
- I got him.

575
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,083
Yaz! No!

576
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,166
Shit.

577
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:58,250
- He's going to his uncle.
- Nik, stay in radio contact.

578
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,375
We need backup!

579
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,125
- Keep going, Nik. Get the boy.
- Tyler...

580
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:42,708
Heads down.

581
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,333
Hey! Come here!

582
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:55,833
Hey!

583
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,458
Come back here.

584
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:07,708
Sandro.

585
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,833
Come on, kid. Come back.

586
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,208
Hey, kid, trust me.
You don't want to do that.

587
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,500
Come, boy.

588
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,750
Come back to your mother.

589
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,541
Don't listen to him.

590
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,041
Your mother did all this
to protect you. Come back.

591
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,458
Come back to us.

592
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,208
Sandro.

593
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,125
Come to your family.

594
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:45,875
Shit!

595
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:54,625
Nik!

596
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,583
Nik, are you all right?

597
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,833
<i>Putain.</i>

598
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:08,333
It wasn't my mother's fault.

599
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,500
She just wanted us to get out of there.

600
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,958
Get in the car. Stay here.

601
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,333
Watch the boy.

602
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,333
Go!

603
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,125
Frag out.

604
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,875
You all right?

605
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,291
Tyler, he's got the kid.
Nik and I are on foot.

606
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,083
Heading streetside. We need evac.

607
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Hold on.

608
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,208
Team three, take them out. Quick.

609
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,500
They're up top.

610
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:11,375
Force them back into the building.

611
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,708
Tyler, we're pinned down!
Hurry up!

612
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,375
<i>Coming to you.</i>

613
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,041
<i>Pin him in!</i>

614
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,583
Stay here.

615
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,791
<i>Do we have
permission to engage?</i>

616
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,041
<i>Shooters on the roof.</i>

617
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,083
<i>Cleared to engage.</i>

618
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,375
<i>Police!</i>

619
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,708
- Nik! Get to the roof. Take their wings.
- Copy.

620
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,916
- Ready? Move!
- Go!

621
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,750
Reload!

622
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,916
Stay with me.

623
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,125
Tyler, we're at the elevator.
Coming to the roof.

624
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:51,958
Move!

625
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,166
We're heading up now.
We're right behind you.

626
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,083
<i>Copy.</i>

627
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,875
<i>They're squeezing us in.
Secure the chopper.</i>

628
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,666
<i>I'll sweep up from the floor below.
Split their focus.</i>

629
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,958
We'll clear out,
and all get matching shirts. Cool?

630
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,333
And wear them this time.

631
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:17,708
Not a chance.

632
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,416
- Team one, they're headed to you.
- We're ready.

633
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:34,166
Sergo, Konstantine, secure the entrance.
Everyone else, up top.

634
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:46,958
Hey.

635
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:48,375
You okay?

636
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,041
You're gonna be okay.

637
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:54,958
I am sorry.

638
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,500
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

639
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,541
Hey.

640
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:02,375
There's nothing to be sorry about.

641
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,750
We'll get you out of here, okay?
Gonna get you back to your sister.

642
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,125
Is he going to kill my mother?

643
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:22,833
If you wanted her alive,

644
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,541
you shouldn't have called.

645
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,916
Yaz! Need you on the 57th floor.
South side.

646
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:18,875
Stay here.

647
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:22,041
Go get the family. I got this.

648
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,125
Go!

649
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm going to enjoy killing you.

650
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,125
Yeah, get in line.

651
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,708
You must really care for this woman.

652
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,208
Good.

653
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:10,083
Now you know how it feels
to lose someone you love.

654
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:30,125
Do you trust me?

655
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:31,791
Should I not?

656
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,750
Get the family.

657
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,416
Traitor!

658
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,750
Yaz!

659
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,791
Yeah. Are you good?

660
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:35,125
Mmm-hmm.

661
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:37,291
Let's go. Let's go.

662
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:39,458
Go, go.

663
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:31,291
Got the family. Heading up.

664
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,375
On my way.

665
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,375
Let's go. Let's go.

666
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:54,666
Yaz?

667
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:00,666
Shit.

668
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,500
Yaz.

669
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,291
Get us up, Nik! Get us up!

670
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,208
Tyler, what's going on?

671
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:40,541
Keep us flying, Nik. Just keep us flying.

672
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,476
- I got you.
- I can't breathe.

673
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,000
- Sorry. Okay...
- Yaz!

674
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:47,333
Look, buddy, hey. Yaz! Yaz!

675
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:49,208
Yaz, look at me, buddy. Eyes on me.

676
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,416
Okay, you stay with me, buddy. I got you!

677
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,166
Yeah, man...

678
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,750
Yaz!

679
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,500
No!

680
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,541
What happened?

681
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:04,125
- Mia!
- Keto.

682
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,375
- Mia.
- Keto.

683
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,541
I thought I'd never see you again.

684
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,541
The whole country is looking for us.

685
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,958
Then go, get on the plane.

686
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,916
We lost ten <i>Nagazi </i>today.

687
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,875
Good soldiers.

688
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:01,541
It's enough.

689
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:02,958
Don't be afraid.

690
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:04,916
It'll be fine.

691
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,916
Be an example to Sandro.

692
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,958
You're no good to him dead,

693
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,833
or rotting in an Austrian prison.

694
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:19,708
How can I be an example to Sandro,

695
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:21,541
if I run away?

696
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:24,250
Let's ask God.

697
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:37,666
"Fear not, for I'm with you."

698
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,250
"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted."

699
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:43,541
I know, I've read it.

700
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,750
I once believed God took your hearing,

701
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:53,041
so he could whisper right into your ear.

702
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,958
But now you only hear your rage.

703
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:00,625
You know who my father
used to compare you to?

704
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:03,708
Do you remember the cricket
from the movie?

705
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:05,791
The one who sits on the boy's nose.

706
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,708
Always chirping nonsense in his ear.

707
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,833
Chirping and chirping, again and again.

708
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,750
Do you remember it?

709
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,250
And where is your father now?

710
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:19,791
Where is your brother?

711
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,458
I always knew
there was a bullet waiting for me,

712
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,583
but not from your gun.

713
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,166
Sweetheart.

714
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,375
You got so big.

715
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,291
Aunt Mia's going to take us
somewhere safe. Okay?

716
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,916
Is Sandro coming?

717
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:48,000
Made you a coffee
if you want. Milk, two sugars.

718
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:58,833
Look, if I had anyone else to ask,
I would have.

719
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:05,375
Yeah, I know. It's, um... It's good.

720
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:11,541
Look, I know you don't want to hear this...

721
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,916
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

722
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:26,208
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I didn't stay. I should have...

723
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,875
Should have been there for you, for him.

724
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:32,125
You're right. I don't wanna hear it.

725
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:43,291
Why didn't you stay?

726
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:49,625
Why didn't you stay?

727
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:54,250
Well, they needed me in, um...
in Kandahar and...

728
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:55,500
We needed you.

729
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,250
- Because I was deployed...
- Why didn't you stay?

730
01:32:58,333 --> 01:33:00,791
- Well, I had orders, and... so I couldn't...
- Bullshit.

731
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,833
- No, why didn't you stay?
- I couldn't...

732
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,083
I couldn't fix it.
I couldn't fucking fix it.

733
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,583
<i>I'm standing here,
staring at my plane.</i>

734
01:33:57,666 --> 01:34:00,000
<i>- But I can't get on it.</i>
- Yeah, why is that?

735
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:03,000
Because I could never live my life
knowing you're still around.

736
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:04,250
Where's the boy?

737
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,375
<i>You think the boy
wants anything to do with you?</i>

738
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:07,833
I think he's confused.

739
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:11,591
Why don't you tell me where you are,
and we can finish what we started?

740
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:13,083
Want to negotiate?

741
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,291
At the airfield. By St. George's Church.

742
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:21,125
I'm not coming to negotiate.

743
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:52,541
Don't do this.

744
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,416
Stay with her. Get them out.

745
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:57,375
Open the door. Open the door!

746
01:34:58,166 --> 01:34:59,166
Tyler!

747
01:36:08,166 --> 01:36:10,791
Sergo! Sergo!

748
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,250
Hurry up.

749
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:05,916
Come.

750
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,750
You want the boy. Here he is.

751
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:12,500
This is between me and you.
Let him go.

752
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,166
No, he stays here.

753
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:20,916
You know, God gave me a mission
to rain vengeance upon your head.

754
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:26,958
Sometimes there is a great sacrifice
in enacting God's will.

755
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:33,916
He's just a kid.

756
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:36,041
Doubt me.

757
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:40,083
Pull the trigger,
consume yourself in a lifetime of guilt.

758
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,708
Life is slowly draining from your body.

759
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,083
I've had worse.

760
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,833
Go. Take his gun.

761
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,541
Don't make me tell you again.

762
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:15,125
Give him the weapon.

763
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:35,250
Now weigh the gun in your hand,
and point at his head.

764
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:41,000
You're a coward.

765
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:43,625
Coward?

766
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:48,958
Cowardice is killing an unarmed man
in the bowels of a prison.

767
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:53,291
I said to point the gun at him.

768
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:07,166
This is the man who killed your father.

769
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:10,291
Avenge him.

770
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,125
Pull the trigger.

771
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,583
It's okay, mate.

772
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,458
Disappointing.

773
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,958
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

774
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,625
Oh, you can exact retribution
for your brother,

775
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,666
but it will be at the cost
of <i>his </i>life right now.

776
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,166
So put the gun down!

777
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:37,125
I'm going to blow his asshole face off.

778
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:39,791
Nik,

779
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,125
the boy.

780
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:58,583
Good girl.

781
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,125
Fuck you.

782
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:48,750
I'm... I'm sorry.

783
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,750
I'm so sorry.

784
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:47,041
I will not...

785
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
stop.

786
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:24,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

787
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:25,583
How are they?

788
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:27,708
Good. Safe.

789
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:30,291
They're in witness protection.

790
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:33,000
I helped her broker a deal
with the Americans.

791
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:36,625
She gave them trade routes,
bank accounts, names.

792
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,333
The Americans froze their assets though.
Took it all.

793
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:45,291
If you go to my cabin in the third
floorboard back from the fireplace,

794
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,958
there's a million in cash.
You can give it to them.

795
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,583
I... I came here because I wanted...

796
01:47:56,666 --> 01:47:57,791
Thank you, Mia.

797
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:01,375
I know, I never said that.

798
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:04,666
I never said "thank you"
for doing what I... couldn't.

799
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,208
His last image of you
wasn't you walking out on him.

800
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:17,791
It was you going off to save people.

801
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:22,750
And he was so brave, Tyler, when it ended.

802
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:27,875
He said, "I want to be brave like Dad."

803
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:38,750
That's how he saw you.

804
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:48,708
Goodbye, Tyler.

805
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:50,750
It's like the goddamn
<i>Sound of Music </i>out here. Isn't it?

806
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,333
Told you not to get caught.

807
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Shit happens, eh?

808
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,416
What if I could get you out?

809
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,250
How does that work?

810
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:06,916
Come and do another job for us.

811
01:50:07,791 --> 01:50:10,166
Not without my team.
I'm not leaving her behind.

812
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:13,791
Yeah. Thought you might say that.

813
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,625
Rake.

814
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:39,083
Rake. That's such a fun name to say.

815
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:42,333
You never told me your name.
Is it as much fun?

816
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:44,375
My name doesn't matter.

817
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:45,875
Yeah? What does?

818
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:47,750
Who I work for.

819
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:49,791
Who's that?

820
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:52,208
A gnarly motherfucker.

821
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:55,750
You'll love him.
